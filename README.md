# &nbsp;Sleep Scheduler 💤

##### 

### Sleep Scheduler is an open-source Python project that tracks and visualizes your nightly sleep hours using interactive charts and a clean, intuitive interface.

##### 

# 🧠 What It Does

##### 

##### \- 📅 Sleep Table View: Log your sleep every night in a color-gradient table that reflects how many hours you slept.

##### \- 🔥 Streak Counter: Earn streaks by sleeping more than 7 hours on consecutive days.

##### \- 📊 Pie Chart: Visualize the percentage of your sleep durations (e.g., 33% of nights were 8–9 hours). You can click on a slice to explore which specific days fall in that range.

##### \- 📈 Line Chart: Track your sleep hours across the month to spot trends or sleep irregularities.

##### \- 🖱️ Interactive Data: Click on any day or chart segment to reveal deeper insights.
